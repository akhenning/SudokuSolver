# SudokuSolver
Made a few years ago, didn't set to public for some reason

Run by filling the array at the top of Solver.java out, and running it. No dependencies. 
 
It does require you to type the input in and out manually, unfortunately. I didn't want to invest the time to hook up OCR functionality for a small project like this

Not commented, though output is fairly verbose I think.

Only cheats a little by guessing ONCE if it can't find a solution with the programmed techniques. And tells you when it does.
Can solve almost all sudoku puzzles without that feature, though! And can solve practically any of them with it.
It refers to this as "brute force" but it only does it once, so it is a legitimate human-viable guessing strategy. Just kinda feels like cheating 
or giving up given the purpose of the program.
If you don't want to use the guess feature, it outputs the final state before guessing too.
