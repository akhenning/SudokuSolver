# SudokuSolver
Made a few years ago, didn't set to public for some reason
 
Requires you to type the input in and out manually, unfortunately. Didn't really want to hook up OCR functionality. Would have been a pain to tell it where to look.

No dependencies. Not commented, though output is fairly verbose I think.

Only cheats a little by guessing ONCE if it can't find a solution with the programmed techniques. And tells you when it does.
Can solve almost all sudoku puzzles without that feature, though! And can solve practically any of them with it.
It refers to this as "brute force" but it only does it once, so it is a legit guessing strat. Just kinda feels like cheating 
or giving up given the purpose of the program.
If you don't want to use the guess feature, it outputs the final state before guessing too.
